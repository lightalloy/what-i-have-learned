# SMACSS

## 5 types of categories:

1) Base
The defaults, almost exclusively single element selectors.

2) Layout rules
Divide the page into sections. Layouts hold one or more modules together.

3) Modules
the reusable, modular parts of our design. They are the callouts, the sidebar sections, the product lists and so on.

4) State rules
Ways to describe how our modules or layouts will look when in a particular state.
Hidden/expanded, active/inactive or describe how modules might look on different pages.

5) Theme rules
Describe how modules or layouts might look, most sites don't require this layer.

## Naming rules

Use a prefix to differentiate between Layout, State, and Module rules:
E.g. l- or layout- for Layout.
State: is-
Modules: just the module itself, .example, .callout, .field.
